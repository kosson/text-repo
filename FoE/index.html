But most importantly, it has enhanced the exercise of our freedom of expression rights both by allowing access to various sources of information but also by significantly democratizing the open publishing of any kind of information.ts both by allowing access to various sources of information but also by significantly democratizing the open publishing of any kind of information.</p>

                        The applicant company owned one of the largest Internet news portals in Estonia. In 2006, following the publication of an article on the portal concerning a ferry company, a number of comments containing personal threats and offensive language directed against the ferry-company owner were posted under the article. Delfi AS removed the offending comments, at the request of the lawyers of the owner of the ferry-company, some six weeks after they were published. Defamation proceedings were instituted against the applicant company, which was ultimately ordered to pay EUR 320 in damages. Acknowledging the “important benefits that could be derived from the Internet in the exercise of freedom of expression”, the Court reiterated that there was no violation of Article 10 and “liability for defamatory or other types of unlawful speech must, in principle, be retained and constitute an effective remedy for violations of personality rights”.

                        The case originated in an application lodged with the Court by the Hungarian Helsinki Committee after being denied by the national authorities access to information about the ex officio defense counsels appointed by two police stations. The Court found that there has been a violation of the right to freedom of expression of the applicant NGO, and has articulated the four threshold criteria for assessing whether a denial of access to State-held information engages Article 10 of the Convention.

                <p lang="en" data-unq="023">While many books and legal studies for judges or other legal practitioners have been published on the subject matter, we believe there is now even greater need to simplify and explain the fundamentals of freedom of expression, especially as applied to the digital world. All this is presented through the lens of the current jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), that should be the main reference point for all European Internet users.</p>

                <p lang="en" data-unq="024">The idea of this brochure emerged also as a result of a few personal experiences in dealing with freedom of expression in the past years:</p>

                <p lang="en" data-unq="025">First, the subject seems to be interesting not only for professional journalists, but also for various other kinds of Internet users who have very diverse educational backgrounds, and, in general, not too much legal knowledge. Nevertheless, they all engage in communicating information on the Internet and sometimes claim the breach of their freedom of expression rights.</p>

                <p lang="en" data-unq="026">Secondly, the policy decision making process surrounding freedom of expression often seems to be hasty, without enough time being allowed for lengthy public debates or for the use of detailed or comprehensive reports, as basis for the decisions. This is especially true for certain countries in South and Eastern Europe. Therefore excerpts of ECtHR arguments and conclusions can be widely accepted points of reference and, as a consequence, a useful advocacy tool in a debate.</p>

                <p lang="en" data-unq="027">Thirdly, in front on the information flow available today many users are looking for easy to understand, distilled information in order to shape their opinion (and not for blocks of legalese text that could look far away or from another century).</p>

                <p lang="en" data-unq="028">But we believe most of the decisions and arguments for freedom of expression in the ECtHR jurisprudence are easily understandable for a wider audience, if presented properly.</p>

                  <cite lang="en" data-unq="029">“Article 10 of the Convention guarantees freedom of expression to “everyone”. No distinction is made in it according to whether the aim pursued is profit-making or not.”</cite>

                        This case concerned the complaint by two of the co-founders of “The Pirate Bay”, one of the world’s largest websites for sharing torrent files, that their conviction for complicity to commit crimes in violation of the Copyright Act had breached their freedom of expression.

                        The Court declared the application inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded. It held that sharing, or allowing others to share, files of this kind on the Internet, even copyright-protected material and for profit-making purposes, was covered by the right to “receive and impart information” under Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the Convention. However, it considered that the domestic courts had rightly balanced the competing interests at stake – i.e. the right of the applicants to receive and impart information and the necessity to protect copyright – when convicting the applicants.

                <p lang="en" data-unq="033">When we don’t like what someone else says, we want them silenced and admonished.</p>

The good news is that there are plenty of political philosophy thinkers, legal documents and court decisions that give us some guidance. And the even better news is that since the legal and juridical implementation of this right in various contexts is always dynamic, anyone could have a say and influence the way policy is implemented. To do so, we need to better understand the basic fundamentals of this right.</p>

Refraining from expression is also a form of the right to freedom of expression (the right to be silent).</p>

Freedom of expression includes the right to access information, which in the case of journalists could mean being granted access in a public institution, including courts, or to a public document, including data of secret services. Whereas in the case of citizens, it could mean no censorship on access to information on the Internet.</p>

                <p lang="en" data-unq="068">Expression can be communicated via various channels: print media, books, letters, posters, broadcasting channels, and – of course, in the past years - mostly via the Internet.</p>

                <p lang="en" data-unq="070">As a fundamental human right, the right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by a number of relevant international law documents and treaties.</p>

                <p lang="en" data-unq="071">The Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948 guarantees the right to freedom of speech in Article 19, and so does the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights adopted by the same body in 1966; it guarantees this right, also under Article 19.</p>

                <p lang="en" data-unq="072">The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union was adopted in 2000 by the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission, and came into force in 2009, and it is considered the ‘Constitution’ of the European Union. It also safeguards the right to freedom of expression under its Article 11.</p>

                <p lang="en" data-unq="073">Of special relevance is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) of the Council of Europe, opened for signature in 1950 that has included freedom of expression in Article 10. It came into force in 1953 and was amended, during the years, by the adoption of 16 Protocols<a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf"><sup>2</sup></a>. Some protocols to the Convention are not yet ratified by each country. The European Court of Human Rights is the body that oversees the implementation of the Convention in the 47 Council of Europe member states.</p>

                <p lang="en" data-unq="074">As the European Convention on Human Rights represents the main human rights instrument for the Council of Europe states, this brochure focuses mainly on the jurisprudence developed by the European Court of Human Rights.</p>

                </h3><br>

                <p lang="en" data-unq="080">The scope of the right to freedom of expression is based on changing philosophical, political and legal concepts. It has to be analyzed bringing in the specific geographical, legal, and social contexts. Most of the times it involves a balancing exercise with other rights and fundamental values.</p>

                <p lang="en" data-unq="081">Therefore, the cases presented in this brochure should only be given a reference value. Such jurisprudence as that of the ECtHR is ever-changing, and sometimes conflicting in itself. It can even be sometimes left to criticism as it results every now and then in disappointing outcomes for those who promote the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and access to information. Moreover, the technical developments of the Internet might change certain assumptions that we have today and that could be included in future decisions.</p>

                <p lang="en" data-unq="082">Nevertheless, such jurisprudence as that of ECtHR can be visionary many times, and it has the important value of promoting the basic standards in legally granting the rights to freedom of expression and access to information.</p>

                <p lang="en" data-unq="083">The distillation of the entire ECtHR current jurisprudence comes at a cost that it is well worth pointing. First of all, the information in this brochure may not constitute in any case legal advice. Second, the editors of the brochure had to limit the information to be presented, a choice that for certain legal professionals might be a shortcoming. Also, the selection of the domains and cases forced us to leave certain important aspects covered very briefly – such as the issues of “hate speech” or “protection of journalistic sources”.</p>

                <p lang="en" data-unq="084">In order to simplify the text in the brochure version, certain quotes have been stripped down from internal references to other ECtHR cases or documents. Also, the name of the case is indicated at a minimum, as “Name of plaintiffs v. Country, year”. The cases decided by the Grand Chamber are marked as such. All the bolding of thetext in the quotes belongs to the editors in order to highlight the main keywords relevant for the reader. Footnote text references are included at the end of the brochure.</p>

                <p lang="en" data-unq="085">More details are included in the web version, available at <a href="https://cases.internetfreedom.blog">https://cases.internetfreedom.blog</a>, that includes a short summary of each case, and links to the actual text of the judgement/decision or to legal summaries.</p>

                <p lang="en" data-unq="086">We would also have to acknowledge that our work has been helped not only by the fact that all information related to the case-law of the ECtHR is publicly available on the Internet, but also due to the existence of various other projects and publications – all available online - that have systematized or analyzed in more detail a lot of the ECtHR jurisprudence related (also to) Article 10.</p>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="099">Freedom from censorship is the most poignant claim done in the name of freedom of expression, maybe even the ground zero action for which the right is claimed. Nevertheless, censorship can take legally accepted forms. Prior restraints (court injunctions forbidding publication of certain material) and seizure of publications can be found to be acceptable forms of content regulation, even if they are many times debatable or controversial.</p>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="100">Censorship represents the system of control over the publishing of books, movies, letters, etc. It could include even user comments on the Internet. There can be state censorship (enforced through its agencies, based on its laws and regulations), but it can also take the form of private censorship, where a private actor decides not to allow certain speech reach into the public arena. Private censorship is more difficult to prove and more challenging. For example, a journalist whose article is not published by a private media outlet will be given by her/his editors the argument of freedom of editorial policy. A user publishing a comment on a website will probably be presented with the argument of the comments policies and regulations.</p>

                      Mladina, a weekly news magazine in Slovenia, complained to the European Court of Human Rights after being ordered to pay €3,000 in damages to a politician. In the context of a debate on LGBT rights, the politician made controversial declarations. The weekly publication admonished the politician in harsh words, saying, amongst others, that his behavior was “the typical attitude of a cerebral bankrupt who is lucky to be living in a country with such a limited pool of human resources that a person of his characteristics can even end up in Parliament, when in a normal country worthy of any respect he could not even be a janitor in the average urban primary school”. European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of the weekly magazine, stating that there had been a violation of Article 10.

                      Predescu is a Romanian journalist who expressed, on a TV show, opinions about the local mayor, saying that he had connections to the underground businesses in the city. The mayor sued her and, during the civil trial, the journalist could not provide a clear factual basis for her allegations. Predescu complained to the European Court of Human Rights, who found that her statements represented an opinion, were made in good faith, and had a reasonable factual basis. Considering also the high amount of damages that had been awarded, there had been a violation of Article 10.

              <p lang="en" data-unq="163">As stated in paragraph 2 of Article 10, the exercise of freedom of expression comes with duties and responsibilities. When expressing publicly, one should act in good faith, provide, in as much as possible, reliable and accurate information, and pursue the public interest.</p>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="164">The media and the NGOs (when acting as public or social watchdogs) are given more protection under the Convention, but only when respecting the conditions above, as there are greater expectations from them in promoting responsible messages to the public. The protection (as well as the special responsibilities) extends to the individuals in these two types of organizations, namely the journalists and the NGO activists and workers. Especially journalists might be expected to maintain the same professional duties and obligations, even when publishing in their own name.</p>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="165">Any private individual expressing publicly should respect the same conditions in order to benefit from the safeguards afforded by Article 10, even if the expectations for providing accurate information are obviously lower in their case. A private individual has limited means of verifying an information, other than sources publicly and easily available. At the same time, while opinions should be freely expressed, it is expected that they have a factual basis. Attribution of facts, such as, let’s say, corruption facts, should not be done careless, as it can lead to the loss of Article 10 safeguards.</p>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="166">The speech of public servants and members of the armed forces is protected, but they also have to give away some of their free speech rights, in interests such as keeping the confidentiality of sensitive or even secret state information, maintaining the military authority or the discipline in the police force. Public employees have a “duty of loyalty, reserve and discretion to their employer” (Guja v. Moldova [Grand Chamber], 2008, ECtHR).</p>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="167">Online expression carries with it even more duties and responsibilities, as the Internet nature gives a potentially permanent existence to all published information and makes it world wide accessible. Analyzing on the matter, the ECtHR considered that a notice about a pending lawsuit can be published online next to litigious articles without being a disproportionate interference with the right to freedom of expression. On the other hand, ECtHR considered that the obligation to remove articles from the Internet, in defamation cases, violates Article 10.</p>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="168">Hate speech as well as incitement to violence, when a violent act is likely to occur, are not protected under the Convention, as they interfere with the principles of the “prohibition of abuse of rights” (Article 17 ECHR) and the “general prohibition of discrimination” (Protocol no. 12 to ECHR, Article 1). This again has a strong impact on the online expression. Nevertheless, hate speech should be differentiated from offensive speech (details about offensive speech in the “Content Regulation” chapter).</p>

                <cite lang="en" data-unq="178">“The crucial watchdog role of the press in a democratic society has been positively asserted and defended by this Court in the course of a large corpus of cases concerning freedom of expression which have stressed not only the right of the press to impart information but also the right of the public to receive it. In so doing the Court has played an important role in laying the foundations for the principles which govern a free press within the Convention community and beyond. However, for the first time the Court is confronted with the question of how to reconcile the role of newspapers to cover a story which is undoubtedly in the public interest with the right to reputation of a group of identifiable private individuals at the centre of the story. In our view the fact that a strong public interest is involved should not have the consequence of exonerating newspapers from either the basic ethics of their trade or the laws of defamation.

                    <p>
                      The applicant, a newspaper editor, was prosecuted in connection with two articles he had published. He was found guilty of defamation, threat of terrorism and inciting ethnic hostility and sentenced to a total of eight and a half years’ imprisonment. The Court considered that both the applicant's conviction and the particularly severe sanction imposed were capable of producing a chilling effect on the exercise of journalistic freedom of expression in Azerbaijan, and leading to dissuading the press from openly discussing matters of public concern, and therefore found there was a violation of Article 10.

              <p lang="en" data-unq="213">One of the crucial roles of the actors on the Internet has been developed by the Internet services, called intermediaries that do not directly create online content, but rather process it in various ways, becoming thus the gatekeepers of what is being published online.</p>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="214">If we are thinking about the current most popular Internet services – such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram or Youtube – they are all based on hosting and making available information produced by other Internet users (user-generated content), thus they are usually called “Internet intermediaries”.</p>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="215">But the range of Internet intermediaries is not only very diverse, but also rapidly changing – both in terms of activity and size on the Internet market, but also in their services, functions or business models. However, on several niches the market is dominated by one or two very large players, which may put them in a position of holding a communication control, that creates additional challenges as a result of their actions on human rights in general and freedom of expression in particular.</p>

                      In May 2008 an Ankara court found that the content of ten pages on the YouTube website infringed the prohibition on insulting the memory of Atatürk, and therefore imposed a blocking order on the entire website. The applicants, who were active users of the website, appealed against that decision. Their appeal was dismissed on the ground that they were not parties to the investigation procedure and therefore did not have standing to challenge the blocking order. The applicants complained that the inability to access YouTube – a platform which they used extensively in their academic work – violated their right to receive and impart information and ideas. The Court found that the blocking order infringed on the applicants’ right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

In the past years, these rules have constantly came into conflict with Internet users actions, that portrayed the activity of these intermediaries as censorship measures - raising questions on new systems of privatized law enforcement models that are put in place.<sup><a href="h​ ttps://edri.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/EDRi_HumanRights_and_PrivLaw_web.pdf" data-toggle="tooltip" title="See https://edri.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/EDRi_HumanRights_and_PrivLaw_web.pdf">14</a></sup></p>

                        The applicant company owned one of the largest Internet news portals in Estonia. In 2006, following the publication of an article on the portal concerning a ferry company, a number of comments containing personal threats and offensive language directed against the ferry-company owner were posted under the article. Delfi AS removed the offending comments, at the request of the lawyers of the owner of the ferry-company, some six weeks after they were published. Defamation proceedings were instituted against the applicant company, which was ultimately ordered to pay EUR 320 in damages.  Acknowledging the “important benefits that could be derived from the Internet in the exercise of freedom of expression”, the Court reiterated that there was no violation of Article 10 and “liability for defamatory or other types of unlawful speech must, in principle, be retained and constitute an effective remedy for violations of personality rights”.

                      The first applicant was a self-regulatory body of Internet content providers and the second applicant was the owner of an Internet news portal. In February 2010, the first applicant published an opinion about two real-estate management websites, the full text of which was subsequently also published on the second applicant’s portal. The opinion attracted user comments, some of which criticized the real-estate websites in derogatory terms. As a result, the company operating the websites brought a civil action against the applicants alleging damage to its reputation. The applicants immediately removed the offending user comments. They were nevertheless found by the domestic courts to bear objective liability for their publication, and ordered to pay procedural fees.

                      European Court of Human Rights had to assess whether an appropriate balance between the applicant’s right to freedom of expression under Article 10 and the plaintiff company’s right to reputation under Article 8 had been struck. Given the absence of hate speech or direct threats to physical integrity in the user comments, the Court found that there was no reason to hold that, if accompanied by effective procedures allowing for a rapid response, the notice-and-take-down-system could not have provided a viable avenue to protect the plaintiff company’s commercial reputation in the present case.

                      The case arose from a blog and a comment that appeared on the website of a small non-profit organization and were defamatory of Mr. Pihl. Upon notice from Mr. Pihl, the organization removed the impugned blog post and the comment, acknowledged their falsity, and apologized to Mr. Pihl. Mr. Pihl subsequently brought defamation proceedings against the organization, but was unsuccessful before the domestic courts. His claim before the European Court of Human Rights rested on the fact that his right to a private life under Article 8 of the European Convention had been violated by the Swedish courts’ inability to hold the organization liable for the third-party content. Upon assessing the balance between the rights safeguarded under Articles 8 and 10 according to the Delfi AS criteria, the Court rejected the application.

                      European Court of Human Rights had to assess whether an appropriate balance between the applicant’s right to freedom of expression under Article 10 and the plaintiff company’s right to reputation under Article 8 had been struck. Given the absence of hate speech or direct threats to physical integrity in the user comments, the Court found that there was no reason to hold that, if accompanied by effective procedures allowing for a rapid response, the notice-and-take-down-system could not have provided a viable avenue to protect the plaintiff company’s commercial reputation in the present case.

                      The case arose from a blog and a comment that appeared on the website of a small non-profit organization and were defamatory of Mr. Pihl. Upon notice from Mr. Pihl, the organization removed the impugned blog post and the comment, acknowledged their falsity, and apologized to Mr. Pihl. Mr. Pihl subsequently brought defamation proceedings against the organization, but was unsuccessful before the domestic courts. His claim before the European Court of Human Rights rested on the fact that his right to a private life under Article 8 of the European Convention had been violated by the Swedish courts’ inability to hold the organization liable for the third-party content. Upon assessing the balance between the rights safeguarded under Articles 8 and 10 according to the Delfi AS criteria, the Court rejected the application.

In 2006, following the publication of an article on the portal concerning a ferry company, a number of comments containing personal threats and offensive language directed against the ferry-company owner were posted under the article. Delfi AS removed the offending comments, at the request of the lawyers of the owner of the ferry-company, some six weeks after they were published. Defamation proceedings were instituted against the applicant company, which was ultimately ordered to pay EUR 320 in damages.  Acknowledging the “important benefits that could be derived from the Internet in the exercise of freedom of expression”, the Court reiterated that there was no violation of Article 10 and “liability for defamatory or other types of unlawful speech must, in principle, be retained and constitute an effective remedy for violations of personality rights”.

                      The first applicant was a self-regulatory body of Internet content providers and the second applicant was the owner of an Internet news portal. In February 2010, the first applicant published an opinion about two real-estate management websites, the full text of which was subsequently also published on the second applicant’s portal. The opinion attracted user comments, some of which criticized the real-estate websites in derogatory terms. As a result, the company operating the websites brought a civil action against the applicants alleging damage to its reputation. The applicants immediately removed the offending user comments. They were nevertheless found by the domestic courts to bear objective liability for their publication, and ordered to pay procedural fees.

                      The first applicant was a self-regulatory body of Internet content providers and the second applicant was the owner of an Internet news portal. In February 2010, the first applicant published an opinion about two real-estate management websites, the full text of which was subsequently also published on the second applicant’s portal. The opinion attracted user comments, some of which criticized the real-estate websites in derogatory terms. As a result, the company operating the websites brought a civil action against the applicants alleging damage to its reputation. The applicants immediately removed the offending user comments. They were nevertheless found by the domestic courts to bear objective liability for their publication, and ordered to pay procedural fees.

Given the absence of hate speech or direct threats to physical integrity in the user comments, the Court found that there was no reason to hold that, if accompanied by effective procedures allowing for a rapid response, the notice-and-take-down-system could not have provided a viable avenue to protect the plaintiff company’s commercial reputation in the present case.

              <p lang="en" data-unq="268">Accessing public interest information (that allows citizens to be updated about the activity of public bodies), is a small, but important part of the right to access information, and it is seen as means for citizens to be informed about the activities performed by the states, and therefore as means of securing democracy.</p>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="269">There are several European Constitutions that state a right to information, both as a human right as well as a general right of access to public interest information, both for individuals as well as for various types of organizations.</p>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="270">There are also specific laws that establish the conditions for accessing public interest information and the obligations of state authorities of putting forward such information, even without a request being made by a citizen or another interested party. These laws contain definitions and lists of what constitutes public interest information, institutions that are circumvented by the law, and means of legal remedies in case of denial of such information.</p>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="271">In its case-law ECtHR has developed <span class="azure">four threshold criteria for assessing whether a denial of access to State-held information engages Article 10 of the Convention (detailed below).</span></p>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="272">Also, the Court stated that national authorities should not discourage the right through measures limiting the access to public interest information, more precisely by allowing “arbitrary restrictions which may become a form of indirect censorship should the authorities create obstacles to the gathering of information.” (TASZ v. Hungary, 2009). Such could be the case of intelligence agencies. The Court said that they might be the subject to the same provisions regarding access to information as any other public body (Case Youth Initiative for Human Rights v. Serbia, 2013). Also, the Court has included the Internet among the protected means of accessing information.</p>

                      In the case of TASZ (the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union) v. Hungary the European Court of Human Rights had to decide whether the denial of access to a document held by the Hungarian Constitutional Court represented an infringement of the organization’s right of access to information, as stated in Article 10 of the Convention.

                      The document, that the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union requested access to, was a complaint filed by an MP with the Constitutional Court (a request for constitutional review of some amendments to the Criminal Code, which concerned drug-related offenses). The Hungarian Civil Liberties Union needed access to this complaint due to its interest in drug-related policies. The Constitutional Court denied the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union’s access to the document, without having consulted the MP, explaining that a complaint pending before it could not be made available to outsiders without the approval of its author. The Hungarian Civil Liberties Union brought a legal action against the Constitutional Court, but the domestic courts ruled against the NGO, considering that the MP’s complaint contained some “data”, but that data was “personal” and could not be accessed without the author’s approval. European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, considering that there has been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention.

                <cite>
                  <p lang="en" data-unq="282">“the Court considers that the <span class="pinkish"><strong>information, data or documents to which access is sought must generally meet a public interest test in order to prompt a need for disclosure</strong></span> under the Convention. Such a need may exist where, inter alia, disclosure provides transparency on the manner of conduct of public affairs and on matters of interest for society as a whole and thereby allows participation in public governance by the public at large.</p><br>

                  <p lang="en" data-unq="282-01">The Court has emphasized that the definition of <span class="pinkish"><strong>what might constitute a subject of public interest will depend on the circumstances of each case</strong></span>. The public interest relates to matters which affect the public to such an extent that it may legitimately take an interest in them, which attract its attention or which concern it to a significant degree, especially in that they affect the well-being of citizens or the life of the community. This is also the case with regard to matters which are capable of giving rise to considerable controversy, which concern an important social issue, or which involve a problem that the public would have an interest in being informed about. The public interest cannot be reduced to the public’s thirst for information about the private life of others, or to an audience’s wish for sensationalism or even voyeurism. In order to ascertain whether a publication relates to a subject of general importance, it is necessary to assess the publication as a whole, having regard to the context in which it appears.“

                      In the case of TASZ (the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union) v. Hungary the European Court of Human Rights had to decide whether the denial of access to a document held by the Hungarian Constitutional Court represented an infringement of the organization’s right of access to information, as stated in Article 10 of the Convention.

                      The document, that the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union requested access to, was a complaint filed by an MP with the Constitutional Court (a request for constitutional review of some amendments to the Criminal Code, which concerned drug-related offenses). The Hungarian Civil Liberties Union needed access to this complaint due to its interest in drug-related policies. The Constitutional Court denied the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union’s access to the document, without having consulted the MP, explaining that a complaint pending before it could not be made available to outsiders without the approval of its author. The Hungarian Civil Liberties Union brought a legal action against the Constitutional Court, but the domestic courts ruled against the NGO, considering that the MP’s complaint contained some “data”, but that data was “personal” and could not be accessed without the author’s approval. European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, considering that there has been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention.

                      The case originated in an application lodged with the Court by the Hungarian Helsinki Committee after being denied by the national authorities access to information about the ex officio defense counsels appointed by two police stations. The Court found that there has been a violation of the right to freedom of expression of the applicant NGO, and has articulated the four threshold criteria for assessing whether a denial of access to State-held information engages Article 10 of the Convention.

                      In the case of TASZ (the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union) v. Hungary the European Court of Human Rights had to decide whether the denial of access to a document held by the Hungarian Constitutional Court represented an infringement of the organization’s right of access to information, as stated in Article 10 of the Convention.

                      The document, that the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union requested access to, was a complaint filed by an MP with the Constitutional Court (a request for constitutional review of some amendments to the Criminal Code, which concerned drug-related offenses). The Hungarian Civil Liberties Union needed access to this complaint due to its interest in drug-related policies. The Constitutional Court denied the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union’s access to the document, without having consulted the MP, explaining that a complaint pending before it could not be made available to outsiders without the approval of its author. The Hungarian Civil Liberties Union brought a legal action against the Constitutional Court, but the domestic courts ruled against the NGO, considering that the MP’s complaint contained some “data”, but that data was “personal” and could not be accessed without the author’s approval. European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, considering that there has been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention.

              <p lang="en" data-unq="308">
                In the past years, different solutions for Internet blocking have been implemented by many states worldwide. There are several reports produced by NGOs such as OpenNet Initiative<sup><a href="https://opennet.net/" data-toggle="tooltip">18</a></sup>, ​Reporters Without Borders <sup><a href="http://surveillance.rsf.org/en" data-toggle="tooltip" title="See the Enemies of the Internet at http://surveillance.rsf.org/en">19</a></sup> or Freedom House<sup><a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-net" data-toggle="tooltip" title="See Freedom of the Net report https://freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-net">20</a></sup>, that provide in-depth analyses of different countries’ practices on Internet censorship that often includes blocking.

              <p lang="en" data-unq="309">There is a wide range of reasons why countries decide to block content, the most common ones being: child abuse images, unauthorized online gambling, intellectual property rights or national security. Besides the Internet blocking obligations for ISPs, that are mandated by a law or a court decision, there is an on-going trend of determining or allowing ISPs to implement similar voluntary measures, that raise also other kinds of problems from a legal standpoint.</p>

                      In May 2008 an Ankara court found that the content of ten pages on the YouTube website infringed the prohibition on insulting the memory of Atatürk, and therefore imposed a blocking order on the entire website. The applicants, who were active users of the website, appealed against that decision. Their appeal was dismissed on the ground that they were not parties to the investigation procedure and therefore did not have standing to challenge the blocking order.

                      The first applicant was a self-regulatory body of Internet content providers and the second applicant was the owner of an Internet news portal. In February 2010, the first applicant published an opinion about two real-estate management websites, the full text of which was subsequently also published on the second applicant’s portal. The opinion attracted user comments, some of which criticized the real-estate websites in derogatory terms. As a result, the company operating the websites brought a civil action against the applicants alleging damage to its reputation. The applicants immediately removed the offending user comments. They were nevertheless found by the domestic courts to bear objective liability for their publication, and ordered to pay procedural fees.

Given the absence of hate speech or direct threats to physical integrity in the user comments, the Court found that there was no reason to hold that, if accompanied by effective procedures allowing for a rapid response, the notice-and-take-down-system could not have provided a viable avenue to protect the plaintiff company’s commercial reputation in the present case.

                      The Court held that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the Convention, finding that the arguments advanced by the French Government with regard to the need for the protection of Prince Albert’s private life and of his right to his own image could not be regarded as sufficient to justify interfering with the judgment in question, and that the domestic courts had not given due consideration to the principles and criteria for balancing the right to respect for private life and the right to freedom of expression.

                      The applicants, Princess Caroline von Hannover and her husband Prince Ernst August von Hannover, complained of the German courts’ refusal to prohibit any further publication of two photographs which had been taken during their holiday, without their knowledge, and which had appeared in two German magazines.

                      This case concerned the conviction of four journalists for having recorded and broadcast an interview of a private insurance broker using a hidden camera, as part of a television documentary intended to denounce the misleading advice provided by insurance brokers.

The Court further also asserted that the applicants deserved the benefit of the doubt in relation to their desire to observe the ethics of journalism as defined by Swiss law, citing the example of their limited use of the hidden camera.

                      The applicants, Princess Caroline von Hannover and her husband Prince Ernst August von Hannover, complained of the German courts’ refusal to prohibit any further publication of two photographs which had been taken during their holiday, without their knowledge, and which had appeared in two German magazines.

In doing so, they had attached fundamental importance to the question whether the photographs, considered in the light of the accompanying articles, had contributed to a debate of general interest. In those circumstances, and having regard to the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the national courts when balancing competing interests, the Court concluded that the latter had not failed to comply with their positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention in the present case

                      The first applicant was a self-regulatory body of Internet content providers and the second applicant was the owner of an Internet news portal. In February 2010, the first applicant published an opinion about two real-estate management websites, the full text of which was subsequently also published on the second applicant’s portal. The opinion attracted user comments, some of which criticized the real-estate websites in derogatory terms. As a result, the company operating the websites brought a civil action against the applicants alleging damage to its reputation. The applicants immediately removed the offending user comments. They were nevertheless found by the domestic courts to bear objective liability for their publication, and ordered to pay procedural fees.

Given the absence of hate speech or direct threats to physical integrity in the user comments, the Court found that there was no reason to hold that, if accompanied by effective procedures allowing for a rapid response, the notice-and-take-down-system could not have provided a viable avenue to protect the plaintiff company’s commercial reputation in the present case.

              <p lang="en" data-unq="387">Another key subject with which freedom of expression enters in conflict is intellectual property rights, and especially copyright. These tensions tend to be more significant in the digital world, when copying large amounts of works becomes technically easier and the digital copy is identical to the original.</p>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="388">In this specific domain, the ECtHR has had just a few cases and a rather straightforward general line. At the same time, we note that the European Court of Justice has had its share of decisions that touched also on the conflict between freedom of expression and intellectual property rights – as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</p>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="389">First, we need to clarify that the ECtHR considers that intellectual property is a form of property and thus is covered by Article 1 of the Protocol no. 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights:</p>

              <article>
                <h4 class="azure largechar" lang="en" data-unq="390">Art. 1 Protection of property</h4><br>
                <p class="largechar"><strong lang="en" data-unq="391">Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.</strong></p>
              </article>

              <div class="citecontainer">
                <cite lang="en" data-unq="392">“In the light of the above-mentioned decisions, the Grand Chamber agrees with the Chamber’s conclusion that <span class="pinkish"><strong>Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is applicable to intellectual property as such​.</strong></span>”</cite>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="394">Similar to the cases of conflict with privacy, in this situation the Court also needs to do a balancing exercise between two rights established by the Convention. In these cases when the exercise has been done by the national courts based on the criteria from the Court jurisprudence, usually the ECtHR intervenes only if there are very strict arguments for the case to be revisited.</p>

                      This case concerned the complaint by two of the co-founders of “The Pirate Bay”, one of the world’s largest websites for sharing torrent files, that their conviction for complicity to commit crimes in violation of the Copyright Act had breached their freedom of expression.

However, it considered that the domestic courts had rightly balanced the competing interests at stake – i.e. the right of the applicants to receive and impart information and the necessity to protect copyright – when convicting the applicants.

                    CJEU held that EU directives precluded a national court from issuing an injunction against a hosting service provider requiring it to install a system for filtering information stored on its servers by its service users, which applied indiscriminately to all those users, as a preventive measure, exclusively at its expense and for an unlimited period, and which was capable of identifying electronic files containing musical, cinematographic or audiovisual work in respect of which the applicant for the injunction claimed to hold intellectual property rights, with a view to preventing those works from being made available to the public in breach of copyright.

              <p lang="en" data-unq="417">Article 10, paragraph 2 of the Convention lists the interests that can be protected when limiting the right to freedom of expression. Besides the interests in the protection of the reputation or rights of others, or the prevention of the disclosure of information received in confidence, that were discussed in the previous chapters, other interests are:</p>

              <ul>
                <li lang="en" data-unq="418">national security, territorial integrity or public safety; the prevention of disorder or crime;</li>
                <li lang="en" data-unq="419">the protection of health or morals;</li>
                <li lang="en" data-unq="420">maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.</li>
              </ul>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="421">Even if, when reading the paragraph 2 of Article 10, someone might think that the Convention text allows a blanket limitation of the right to freedom of expression, for the listed interests, the jurisprudence of the ECtHR has detailed when such limitation might be “necessary in a democratic society”, as well as when that might not be the case, and the right to freedom of expression prevails.</p>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="422">While there are cases when expression limitations are upheld by the ECtHR, there is also a large array of cases where the member states of the Council of Europe were found in violation of Article 10, when attempting to protect the above listed interests.</p>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="423">For example, the need to protect national security allows for limitations of the right to freedom of expression, but it has to be proved by authorities that these limitations are indeed necessary in a democratic society.</p>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="424">On the other hand, in what regards pornography and blasphemy, these might be more easily limited in the interests of protecting health or morals. Protecting the rights of children is paramount. Child pornography is illegal.</p>

It is in this perspective that the Court finds that that reasons adduced by the respondent State for the applicant’s conviction are both relevant and sufficient to ground an interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression. The Court reiterates that the mere fact that “information” or “ideas” offend, shock or disturb does not suffice to justify that interference (see paragraph 36 above). What is in issue in the instant case, however, is incitement to violence.”

                      The owner of a newspaper was charged by the Turkish authorities with disseminating propaganda against the indivisibility of the State, and was ordered to pay a fine. The conviction was the consequence of a commentary that was published in the newspaper that he owned. The Court found that the interests in protecting national security and territorial integrity, in the specific context of the case, were proportional with the restriction upon freedom of expression, as the article’s wording was not just offensive, shocking or disturbing, but had the capacity to incite to violence.

                      The case concerned the failure of national authorities in Finland in protecting the right to privacy of a minor, whose photo was published by an unknown person or persons on an website, next to an announcement that was claiming that the minor was looking for an intimate relationship with a boy of his age or older. The national courts upheld the Internet Service Provider refusal of disclosing the identity of the person who has posted the photo, the contact details and the misleading announcement. The refusal was based on the legislation in effect at the time, adopted with the aim to protect freedom of expression, legislation that was prohibiting the disclosure of users’ identity. European Court of Human Rights unanimously held there had been a violation of the minor’s privacy rights.

              <p lang="en" data-unq="449">There is a common understanding, reflected in the European legal systems, and the ECtHR jurisprudence, that there should exist no licensing systems for print publications.</p>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="450">States must not have a say in the appearance on the market of a new publication, which definitely includes Internet publications, in all their forms and shapes. This is a basic principle of freedom of the press.</p>

              <p lang="en" data-unq="451">Nevertheless, there also exists an agreement that, for broadcast media, a licensing system should exist. This limitation is argued to come, amongst others, from the practical matter of a limited availability of broadcasting spectrum, and it brings with it further limitations, such as the existence of national broadcasting legislation that settles restrictive conditions for broadcasting (for example, limitative programming requirements). National broadcasting supervision authorities are established in the European states for the implementation of such legislation.</p>
