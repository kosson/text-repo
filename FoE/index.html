                </h3><br>

                <p>The Internet has significantly changed our lives in the past years in many areas, including the way we access and publish information. But most importantly, it has enhanced the exercise of our freedom of expression rights both by allowing access to various sources of information but also by significantly democratizing the open publishing of any kind of information.ts both by allowing access to various sources of information but also by significantly democratizing the open publishing of any kind of information.</p>

                <div class="citecontainer">
                  <cite>“In the light of its accessibility and its capacity to store and communicate vast amounts of information, the Internet plays an important role in enhancing the public’s access to news and facilitating the dissemination of information in general.”</cite>

                </div>

                <p>Consequently, this has turned the freedom of expression – especially in the online environment – in a subject that concerns us all. Not just the journalists or the NGOs dealing with freedom of expression.</p>

                <div class="citecontainer">

                </div>

                <p>Also it has become essential that the information explaining the basic concepts around freedom of expression and the relevant court’s jurisprudence are simplified and explained to a large audience that could be interested in the subject.</p>

                <div class="citecontainer">
                  <cite>“the function of bloggers and popular users of the social media may be also assimilated to that of “public watchdogs” in so far as the protection afforded by Article 10 is concerned.”</cite>

                </div>

                <p>While many books and legal studies for judges or other legal practitioners have been published on the subject matter, we believe there is now even greater need to simplify and explain the fundamentals of freedom of expression, especially as applied to the digital world. All this is presented through the lens of the current jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), that should be the main reference point for all European Internet users.</p>

                <p>The idea of this brochure emerged also as a result of a few personal experiences in dealing with freedom of expression in the past years:</p>

                <p>First, the subject seems to be interesting not only for professional journalists, but also for various other kinds of Internet users who have very diverse educational backgrounds, and, in general, not too much legal knowledge. Nevertheless, they all engage in communicating information on the Internet and sometimes claim the breach of their freedom of expression rights.</p>

                <p>Secondly, the policy decision making process surrounding freedom of expression often seems to be hasty, without enough time being allowed for lengthy public debates or for the use of detailed or comprehensive reports, as basis for the decisions. This is especially true for certain countries in South and Eastern Europe. Therefore excerpts of ECtHR arguments and conclusions can be widely accepted points of reference and, as a consequence, a useful advocacy tool in a debate.</p>

                <p>Thirdly, in front on the information flow available today many users are looking for easy to understand, distilled information in order to shape their opinion (and not for blocks of legalese text that could look far away or from another century).</p>

                <p>But we believe most of the decisions and arguments for freedom of expression in the ECtHR jurisprudence are easily understandable for a wider audience, if presented properly.</p>

                </h3><br>

                <p>Freedom of expression is a widely used, many times abused, and yet insufficiently understood fundamental right.</p>

                <p>When we don’t like what someone else says, we want them silenced and admonished.</p>

                <p>When we want to say something, ostensibly under the same lines as the speech we disagree with, we think we are entitled to freely do so.</p>

                <p>But why do we have a fundamental right to freedom of expression, what is it useful for and why and when and how shall this right be limited, we rarely consider.</p>

                <div class="citecontainer">
                  Freedom of expression <cite>is applicable not only to "information" or "ideas" that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society"</cite>.
                  <p class="refer">Axel Springer v. Germany [Grand Chamber], ECtHR, 2012</p>
                </div>

                <p>There is no agreed line of thinking answering to the above statements. The good news is that there are plenty of political philosophy thinkers, legal documents and court decisions that give us some guidance. And the even better news is that since the legal and juridical implementation of this right in various contexts is always dynamic, anyone could have a say and influence the way policy is implemented. To do so, we need to better understand the basic fundamentals of this right.</p>

                <p>A summary of some of the key concepts behind the right to freedom of expression is listed below.</p>

                <h4 class="azure largechar"><i>What</i> is freedom of expression?</h4><br>

                <div class="citecontainer">
                  <cite>“​Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual’s self-fulfilment.”</cite>

                <ul>
                  <li>It is an important instrument of freedom of conscience</li>
                  <li>It allows for conscient choices based on adherence to certain values, and therefore grants individual autonomy and defines each person’s identity</li>
                  <li>It contributes to knowledge and understanding, by debating about social and moral values and allowing for a marketplace-of-ideas</li>
                  <li>It allows for the communication of political ideas, and therefore contributes to democracy</li>
                  <li>It builds tolerance by allowing the others to express themselves</li>
                  <li>It contributes to the artistic development, and it facilitates academic and scientific progress<sup><a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="David Feldman “Civil Liberties and Human Rights in England and Wales”, Oxford University Press 2002 (p.772 – 766">1</a></sup></li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="azure largechar"><i>What</i> does freedom of expression consist of?</h4>

                <ul>
                  <li>the right to disseminate information, in all forms and shapes, and;</li>
                  <li>the right of the others to receive it.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="citecontainer">
                  Freedom of expression <cite>“applies not only to the content of information but also to the means of dissemination, since any restriction imposed on the means necessarily interferes with the right to receive and impart information”</cite>.

                </div>

                <h4 class="azure largechar"><i>Why</i> are we limiting freedom of expression?</h4>

                <ul>
                  <li>Because it is harming the exercise of other rights (the right to privacy, the right to a fair trial, the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion) or it is overstepping fundamental human rights boundaries (the prohibition of discrimination and the prohibition of abuse of rights)</li>
                  <li>Because it is not done in good faith (publication of insufficiently verified facts, pure offensive language that serves no public interest debate, etc.)</li>
                  <li>Because it is harmful and it is not of public interest</li>
                  <li>Because it is endangering the safeguarding of democracy or the law and order (divulging state secrets, risking a breach of peace, etc.)</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="citecontainer">
                  <cite>“As set forth in Article 10, freedom of expression is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly.”</cite>

                </div>

                <h4 class="azure largechar"><i>How</i> should these limits be?</h4>

                <ul>
                  <li>Provided by law</li>
                  <li>Pursue a legitimate aim (protect other rights or interests)</li>
                  <li>Necessary in a democratic society (there has to exist a pressing social need)</li>
                  <li>Proportional</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Expression can take various forms: spoken and written words, art works, films, theatre music, other performing arts or happenings, including the destruction of property, when such an act has a “speech” content (real-life examples would include the burning of the national flag, throwing a paint can on a statue). Refraining from expression is also a form of the right to freedom of expression (the right to be silent).</p>

                <p>Freedom of expression encompasses a wide spectrum of communications, from political expression, to academic, artistic or commercial communication, each of these being afforded different levels of protection. Freedom of expression includes the right to access information, which in the case of journalists could mean being granted access in a public institution, including courts, or to a public document, including data of secret services. Whereas in the case of citizens, it could mean no censorship on access to information on the Internet.</p>

                <p>Expression can be communicated via various channels: print media, books, letters, posters, broadcasting channels, and – of course, in the past years - mostly via the Internet.</p>

                  <span class="pinkish largechar">Freedom of expression as a fundamental right</span>
                </h3><br>

                <p>As a fundamental human right, the right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by a number of relevant international law documents and treaties.</p>

                <p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948 guarantees the right to freedom of speech in Article 19, and so does the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights adopted by the same body in 1966; it guarantees this right, also under Article 19.</p>

                <p>The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union was adopted in 2000 by the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission, and came into force in 2009, and it is considered the ‘Constitution’ of the European Union. It also safeguards the right to freedom of expression under its Article 11.</p>

                <p>Of special relevance is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) of the Council of Europe, opened for signature in 1950 that has included freedom of expression in Article 10. It came into force in 1953 and was amended, during the years, by the adoption of 16 Protocols<a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf"><sup>2</sup></a>. Some protocols to the Convention are not yet ratified by each country. The European Court of Human Rights is the body that oversees the implementation of the Convention in the 47 Council of Europe member states.</p>

                <p>As the European Convention on Human Rights represents the main human rights instrument for the Council of Europe states, this brochure focuses mainly on the jurisprudence developed by the European Court of Human Rights.</p>

                  <span class="pinkish largechar">How to understand this brochure</span>
                </h3><br>

                <p>The scope of the right to freedom of expression is based on changing philosophical, political and legal concepts. It has to be analyzed bringing in the specific geographical, legal, and social contexts. Most of the times it involves a balancing exercise with other rights and fundamental values.</p>

                <p>Therefore, the cases presented in this brochure should only be given a reference value. Such jurisprudence as that of the ECtHR is ever-changing, and sometimes conflicting in itself. It can even be sometimes left to criticism as it results every now and then in disappointing outcomes for those who promote the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and access to information. Moreover, the technical developments of the Internet might change certain assumptions that we have today and that could be included in future decisions.</p>

                <p>Nevertheless, such jurisprudence as that of ECtHR can be visionary many times, and it has the important value of promoting the basic standards in legally granting the rights to freedom of expression and access to information. The distillation of the entire ECtHR current jurisprudence comes at a cost that it is well worth pointing. First of all, the information in this brochure may not constitute in any case legal advice. Second, the editors of the brochure had to limit the information to be presented, a choice that for certain legal professionals might be a shortcoming. Also, the selection of the domains and cases forced us to leave certain important aspects covered very briefly – such as the issues of “hate speech” or “protection of journalistic sources”.</p>

                <p>In order to simplify the text in the brochure version, certain quotes have been stripped down from internal references to other ECtHR cases or documents. Also, the name of the case is indicated at a minimum, as “Name of plaintiffs v. Country, year”. The cases decided by the Grand Chamber are marked as such.

              <p>Freedom from censorship is the most poignant claim done in the name of freedom of expression, maybe even the ground zero action for which the right is claimed. Nevertheless, censorship can take legally accepted forms. Prior restraints (court injunctions forbidding publication of certain material) and seizure of publications can be found to be acceptable forms of content regulation, even if they are many times debatable or controversial.</p>

              <p>Censorship represents the system of control over the publishing of books, movies, letters, etc. It could include even user comments on the Internet. There can be state censorship (enforced through its agencies, based on its laws and regulations), but it can also take the form of private censorship, where a private actor decides not to allow certain speech reach into the public arena. Private censorship is more difficult to prove and more challenging. For example, a journalist whose article is not published by a private media outlet will be given by her/his editors the argument of freedom of editorial policy. A user publishing a comment on a website will probably be presented with the argument of the comments policies and regulations.</p>

              <h4 class="azure largechar">Concepts such as:</h4><br>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the need for granting a fair trial,</li>
                  <li>the need for the protection of children, or health and morals,</li>
                  <li>the need for the protection of the reputation or rights of others,</li>
                  <li>the need for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or</li>
                  <li>national security</li>
                </ul>
                are all used as arguments and legal grounds in regulating content.
              </p>

              <p>In preventing the excessive use of punitive measures aimed at regulating content and, consequently leading to free expression being discouraged, the European Court of Human Rights has developed a vast jurisprudence. Some guiding principles can be found below.</p>

Unlike the latter, the former inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large, and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance. No doubt Article 10 para. 2 enables the reputation of others - that is to say, of all individuals - to be protected, and this protection extends to politicians too, even when they are not acting in their private capacity; but in such cases the requirements of such protection have to be weighed in relation to the interests of open discussion of political issues”</cite>."

              <p>As stated in paragraph 2 of Article 10, the exercise of freedom of expression comes with duties and responsibilities. When expressing publicly, one should act in good faith, provide, in as much as possible, reliable and accurate information, and pursue the public interest.</p>
              <p>The media and the NGOs (when acting as public or social watchdogs) are given more protection under the Convention, but only when respecting the conditions above, as there are greater expectations from them in promoting responsible messages in the public. The protection (as well as the special responsibilities) extends to the individuals in these two types of organizations, namely the journalists and the NGO activists and workers. Especially journalists might be expected to maintain the same professional duties and obligations, even when publishing in their own name.</p>
              <p>Any private individual expressing publicly should respect the same conditions in order to benefit from the safeguards afforded by Article 10, even if the expectations for providing accurate information are obviously lower in their case. A private individual has limited means of verifying an information, other than sources publicly and easily available. At the same time, while opinions should be freely expressed, it is expected that they have a factual basis. Attribution of facts, such as, let’s say, corruption facts, should not be done careless, as it can lead to the loss of Article 10 safeguards.</p>
              <p>The speech of the public servants and members of the armed forces is protected, but they also have to give away some of their free speech rights, in interests such as keeping the confidentiality of sensitive or even secret state information, maintaining the military authority or the discipline in the police force. Public employees have a “duty of loyalty, reserve and discretion to their employer” (Guja v. Moldova [Grand Chamber], 2008, ECtHR).</p>
              <p>Online expression carries with it even more duties and responsibilities, as the Internet nature gives a potentially permanent existence to all published information and makes it world wide accessible. Analyzing on the matter, the ECtHR considered that a notice about a pending lawsuit can be published online next to litigious articles without being a disproportionate interference with the right to freedom of expression. On the other hand, ECtHR considered that the obligation to remove articles from the Internet, in defamation cases, violates Article 10.</p>
              <p>Hate speech as well as incitement to violence, when a violent act is likely to occur, are not protected under the Convention, as they interfere with the principles of the “prohibition of abuse of rights” (Article 17 ECHR) and the “general prohibition of discrimination” (Protocol no. 12 to ECHR, Article 1). This again has a strong impact on the online expression. Nevertheless, hate speech should be differentiated from offensive speech (details about offensive speech in the “Content Regulation” chapter).</p>

              <h4 class="azure largechar">Act in good faith, provide reliable information, and pursue the public interest</h4>

              <cite>“The crucial watchdog role of the press in a democratic society has been positively asserted and defended by this Court in the course of a large corpus of cases concerning freedom of expression which have stressed not only the right of the press to impart information but also the right of the public to receive it. In so doing the Court has played an important role in laying the foundations for the principles which govern a free press within the Convention community and beyond. However, for the first time the Court is confronted with the question of how to reconcile the role of newspapers to cover a story which is undoubtedly in the public interest with the right to reputation of a group of identifiable private individuals at the centre of the story. In our view the fact that a strong public interest is involved should not have the consequence of exonerating newspapers from either the basic ethics of their trade or the laws of defamation."

              <p>One of the crucial roles of the actors on the Internet has been developed by the Internet services, called intermediaries that do not directly create online content, but rather process it in various ways, becoming thus the gatekeepers of what is being published online.</p>

              <p>If we are thinking about the current most popular Internet services – such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram or Youtube – they are all based on hosting and making available information produced by other Internet users (user-generated content), thus they are usually called “Internet intermediaries”."
              "But the range of Internet intermediaries is not only very diverse, but also rapidly changing – both in terms of activity and size on the Internet market, but also in their services, functions or business models. However, on several niches the market is dominated by one or two very large players, which may put them in a position of holding a communication control, that creates additional challenges as a result of their actions on human rights in general and freedom of expression in particular.</p>

              <cite>“the Court accepts that <span class="pinkish"><strong>YouTube is a unique platform</strong></span> on account of its characteristics, its accessibility and above all its potential impact, and <span class="pinkish"><strong>that no alternatives were available</strong></span> to the applicants.”</cite>
              <p class="refer">Cengiz and Others v. Turkey, 2015</p>

              <p>Moreover, the Internet intermediaries have adopted their own rules – known usually as terms and conditions - for the use of the platform, that include policies on content, but also rules for its blocking or removal. In the past years, these rules have constantly came into conflict with Internet users actions, that portrayed the activity of these intermediaries as censorship measures - raising questions on new systems of <a href="privatized law enforcement models that are put in place">privatized law enforcement models that are put in place</a>.

              "In this context, the role of the Internet intermediaries is becoming increasingly complex, torn between their current business models, respecting human rights and receiving complaints on very diverse issues mixed up with different legislative obligations diverging from one jurisdiction to another.</p>
              <p>While the ECtHR jurisprudence on the matter is still in the beginning (and all the cases focus on just a specific situation - comments left by other users on other websites), it is worth pointing out the work of the Council of <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/freedom-expression/committee-of-experts-on-internet-intermediaries-msi-net-">Europe Committee of experts on Internet Intermediaries</a> that has prepared standard setting proposals on the roles and responsibilities of Internet intermediaries, including a study on human rights dimensions of automated data processing techniques (in particular algorithms) and possible regulatory implications (The draft text is available at <a href="https://rm.coe.int/draft-recommendation-on-internet-intermediaries-7th-revised-version-/1680770c37">https://rm.coe.int/draft-recommendation-on-internet-intermediaries-7th-revised-version-/1680770c37</a>).</p>

              <h4 class="azure largechar">Online platforms have duties and responsibilities on freedom of expression, but their role is different from a traditional publisher</h4>

              <cite>“In the recent Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers to the member States of the Council of Europe on a new notion of media, this is termed a “differentiated and graduated approach [that] requires that each actor whose services are identified as media or as an intermediary or auxiliary activity benefit from both the appropriate form (differentiated) and the appropriate level (graduated) of protection and that responsibility also be delimited in conformity with Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and other relevant standards developed by the Council of Europe”. Therefore, the Court considers that because of the particular nature of the Internet, the “duties and responsibilities” that are to be conferred on an Internet news portal for the purposes of Article 10 may differ to some degree from those of a traditional publisher, as regards third-party content.”</cite>
              <p class="refer">Delfi AS v. Estonia [Grand Chamber], 2015</p>

              <h4 class="azure largechar">The commercial nature and the public impact/ audience of the intermediaries needs to be taken into account</h4>

              <cite>“The Court considers that the case concerns the “duties and responsibilities” of Internet news portals, under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention, when they provide for economic purposes a platform for user-generated comments on previously published content and some users – whether identified or anonymous – engage in clearly unlawful speech, which infringes the personality rights of others and amounts to hate speech and incitement to violence against them. <span class="pinkish"><strong>The Court emphasises that the present case relates to a large professionally managed Internet news portal run on a commercial basis which published news articles of its own and invited its readers to comment on them</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>Accordingly, <span class="pinkish"><strong>the case does not concern other fora</strong></span> on the Internet where third-party comments can be disseminated, <span class="pinkish"><strong>for example an Internet discussion forum or a bulletin board</strong></span> where users can freely set out their ideas on any topics without the discussion being channelled by any input from the forum’s manager; <span class="pinkish"><strong>or a social media platform</strong></span> where the platform provider does not offer any content and where the content provider may be a private person running the website or a blog as a hobby.”</cite>

              <cite>“the Court <span class="pinkish"><strong>attaches importance to the fact that the association is a small non-profit association, unknown to the wider public</strong></span>, and it was thus unlikely that it would attract a large number of comments or that the comment about the applicant would be widely read.”</cite>

              <h4 class="azure largechar">The nature of the material that needs to be taken down has to be taken into consideration</h4>

              <cite><span class="pinkish"><strong>“the impugned comments</strong></span> in the present case, as assessed by the Supreme Court, <span class="pinkish"><strong>mainly constituted hate speech and speech that directly advocated acts of violence</strong></span>.

              <cite>“Furthermore, <span class="pinkish"><strong>the expressions used in the comments were offensive, one of them being outright vulgar</strong></span>. As the Court has previously held, offence may fall outside the protection of freedom of expression if it amounts to wanton denigration, for example where the sole intent of the offensive statement is to insult; but the use of vulgar phrases in itself is not decisive in the assessment of an offensive expression. For the Court, style constitutes part of the communication as the form of expression and is as such protected together with the content of the expression.</p>
              <p><span class="pinkish"><strong>For the Court, the expressions used in the comments, albeit belonging to a low register of style, are common in communication on many Internet portals</strong></span> – a consideration that reduces the impact that can be attributed to those expressions.”</cite>

                <h4 class="azure largechar">Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights</h4>
                <h4 class="azure largechar">Freedom of expression</h4><br>
                <cite class="largechar">... This right shall include freedom … to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.</cite>
              </article><br>

              <p>Accessing public interest information (that allows citizens to be updated about the activity of public bodies), is a small, but important part of the right to access information, and it is seen as means for citizens to be informed about the activities performed by the states, and therefore as means of securing democracy.</p>
              <p>There are several European Constitutions that state a right to information, both as a human right as well as a general right of access to public interest information, both for individuals as well as for various types of organizations.</p>
              <p>There are also specific laws that establish the conditions for accessing public interest information and the obligations of state authorities of putting forward such information, even without a request being made by a citizen or another interested party. These laws contain definitions and lists of what constitutes public interest information, institutions that are circumvented by the law, and means of legal remedies in case of denial of such information.</p>
              <p>In its case-law ECtHR has developed <span class="azure largechar">four threshold criteria for assessing whether a denial of access to State-held information engages Article 10 of the Convention (detailed below)</span>.</p>
              <p>Also, the Court stated that national authorities should not discourage the right through measures limiting the access to public interest information, more precisely by allowing “arbitrary restrictions which may become a form of indirect censorship should the authorities create obstacles to the gathering of information.” (TASZ v. Hungary, 2009). Such could be the case of intelligence agencies. The Court said that they might be the subject to the same provisions regarding access to information as any other public body (Case Youth Initiative for Human Rights v. Serbia, 2013). Also, the Court has included the Internet among the protected means of accessing information.</p>

              <h4 class="azure largechar"><img src="img/key.svg" alt="element cheie">Key aspects from relevant ECtHR cases:</h4><br>
              <h4 class="azure largechar">Definition of the freedom to receive information</h4>
              <cite>“(…) <span class="pinkish"><strong>the right to receive and impart information explicitly forms part of the right to freedom of expression under Article 10. That right basically prohibits a Government from restricting a person from receiving information that others wish or may be willing to impart to him.</strong></span>”</cite>
              <p class="refer">TASZ v. Hungary, 2009, citing Leander v. Sweden, 1987</p>

              <h4 class="azure largechar">Four threshold criteria for assessing if the freedom of expression is breached by the state not providing the public information requested</h4>

              <h4 class="azure largechar">a) The purpose of the information request (contributing to a public debate)</h4><br>
              <cite>“(…) the Court has placed emphasis on whether <span class="pinkish"><strong>the gathering of the information was a relevant preparatory step in journalistic activities or in other activities creating a forum for, or constituting an essential element of, public debate</strong></span> (…). For the Court, <span class="pinkish"><strong>obtaining access to information would be considered necessary if withholding it would hinder or impair the individual’s exercise of his or her right to freedom of expression</strong></span> (…), including the freedom “to receive and impart information and ideas”, in a manner consistent with such “duties and responsibilities” as may follow from paragraph 2 of Article 10.”</cite>
              <p class="refer">Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v. Hungary [Grand Chamber], 2016</p>

              <h4 class="azure largechar">b) The nature of the information sought (it must be information of public interest)</h4><br>
              <cite>“the Court considers that the <span class="pinkish"><strong>information, data or documents to which access is sought must generally meet a public interest test in order to prompt a need for disclosure</strong></span> under the Convention. Such a need may exist where, inter alia, disclosure provides transparency on the manner of conduct of public affairs and on matters of interest for society as a whole and thereby allows participation in public governance by the public at large."<br>
              "The Court has emphasized that the definition of what might constitute a subject of public interest will depend on the circumstances of each case. The public interest relates to matters which affect the public to such an extent that it may legitimately take an interest in them, which attract its attention or which concern it to a significant degree, especially in that they affect the well-being of citizens or the life of the community. This is also the case with regard to matters which are capable of giving rise to considerable controversy, which concern an important social issue, or which involve a problem that the public would have an interest in being informed about. The public interest cannot be reduced to the public’s thirst for information about the private life of others, or to an audience’s wish for sensationalism or even voyeurism. In order to ascertain whether a publication relates to a subject of general importance, it is necessary to assess the publication as a whole, having regard to the context in which it appears.“

              <h4 class="azure largechar">c) The role of the applicant (social watchdogs – including bloggers and social media users):</h4><br>
              <cite>“(…) in assessing whether the respondent State had interfered with the applicants’ Article 10 rights by denying access to certain documents, <span class="pinkish"><strong>the Court has previously attached particular weight to the applicant’s role as a journalist (…) or as a social watchdog or non-governmental organisation whose activities related to matters of public interest (…).

              <p class="refer">Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v. Hungary [Grand Chamber], 2016</p>

              <cite>“The function of the press includes the creation of forums for public debate. However, the realisation of this function is not limited to the media or professional journalists. In the present case, the preparation of the forum of public debate was conducted by a non-governmental organisation. The purpose of the applicant's activities can therefore be said to have been an essential element of informed public debate. <span class="pinkish"><strong>The Court has repeatedly recognised civil society's important contribution to the discussion of public affairs</strong></span> (…).”</cite>
              <p class="refer">TASZ v. Hungary, 2009</p>

              <cite>“(…) the function of creating forums for public debate is not limited to the press. That function may also be exercised by non-governmental organisations, the activities of which are an essential element of informed public debate. The Court has therefore accepted that <span class="pinkish"><strong>non-governmental organisations, like the press, may be characterised as social “watchdogs”</strong></span>. In that connection their activities warrant similar Convention protection to that afforded to the press.”</cite>

              <p class="refer">Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v. Hungary [Grand Chamber], 2016</p>

              <h4 class="azure largechar">d) The information requested was ready and available</h4>

              <cite>“(…) the Court has previously had regard to the fact that the <span class="pinkish"><strong>information sought was “ready and available” and did not necessitate the collection of any data by the Government</strong></span> (…). On the other hand, the Court dismissed a domestic authority’s reliance on the anticipated difficulty of gathering information as a ground for its refusal to provide the applicant with documents, where such difficulty was generated by the authority’s own practice (…)</cite>”."

              <cite>“The most careful scrutiny on the part of the Court is called for when the measures taken by the national authority are capable of discouraging the participation of the press, one of society’s “watchdogs”, in the public debate on matters of legitimate public concern (…), even measures which merely make access to information more cumbersome.
              <span class="pinkish"><strong>In view of the interest protected by Article 10, the law cannot allow arbitrary restrictions which may become a form of indirect censorship should the authorities create obstacles to the gathering of information.</strong></span>”</cite>

              <p>The Internet blocking of a web page via Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that provide access to the Internet is a form of limitation of access to content.</p>
              <p>While Internet blocking often seems a simple and easy solution for some policy makers to deal with illegal content, in fact it raises some very complicated technical (<a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2017/internet-content-blocking/">see ISOC’s Internet Society Perspectives on Internet Content Blocking: An Overview</a>) and legal issues (Internet Blocking: Balancing Cybercrime Responses in Democratic Societies available at <a href="http://www.aconite.com/blocking/study">http://www.aconite.com/blocking/study</a>), among which the conflict between Internet blocking and freedom of expression.</p>
              <p>In the past years, different solutions for Internet blocking have been implemented by many states worldwide. There are several reports produced by NGOs such as <a href="https://opennet.net/ ">OpenNet Initiative</a>, Reporters Without Borders (see the Enemies of the Internet at <a href="http://surveillance.rsf.org/en">http://surveillance.rsf.org/en</a>) or Freedom House (see Freedom of the Net report <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-net">https://freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-net</a>), that provide in-depth analyses of different countries’ practices on Internet censorship that often includes blocking.</p>
              <p>There is a wide range of reasons why countries decide to block content, the most common ones being: child abuse images, unauthorized online gambling, intellectual property rights or national security. Besides the Internet blocking obligations for ISPs, that are mandated by a law or a court decision, there is an on-going trend of determining or allowing ISPs to implement similar voluntary measures, that raise also other kinds of problems from a legal standpoint.</p>

              <p>One of the most complicated limitations of the right to freedom of expression is when the other party is also claiming that they have their own fundamental rights breached, and especially the right to privacy – or as the European Convention defines it in Article 8 – the right to respect for private and family life.</p>

              <article>
                <h4 class="azure largechar">ARTICLE 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights</h4>
                <h4 class="azure largechar">Right to respect for private and family life</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.</li>
                  <li>There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.</li>
                </ol>
              </article>

              <cite>One of the reasons for which the notion of private life creates so many problems is that the concept is rather broad and can not have a very strict definition, even according to the ECtHR’s jurisprudence.
              Thus private live “extends to <span class="pinkish"><strong>aspects relating to personal identity</strong></span>, such as a person’s name, photograph, or physical and moral integrity. This concept also includes <span class="pinkish"><strong>the right to live privately, away from unwanted attention</strong></span>. The guarantee afforded by Article 8 of the Convention in this regard is primarily intended <span class="pinkish"><strong>to ensure the development, without outside interference, of the personality of each individual</strong></span> in his or her relations with other human beings. There is thus a zone of interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which may fall within the scope of private life.”</cite>
              <p class="refer">Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associés v. France [Grand Chamber], 2015</p>

              <p>ECtHR considers that both rights (freedom of expression and the right to privacy) have equal respect and, therefore, it is irrelevant on what article was based an application, as a case assessment that leads to a good solution is one that should respect both.</p>
              <p>Attempting to find a proper solution in giving priority to one of the two rights is called “balancing” in the jargon of the ECtHR and it is very often linked to the particularities of every case.</p>

              <cite>“When examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interests of the “protection of the reputation or rights of others”, <span class="pinkish"><strong>the Court may be required to ascertain whether the domestic authorities have struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the Convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases</strong></span>, namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by Article 10, and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 8.”</cite>
              <p class="refer">MTE and Index.hu v. Hungary, 2016</p>

              <p>The conflicts between the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy have appeared well before the Internet existed, so the ECtHR has already a significant jurisprudence in this respect. However, the digital world has also brought into this debate the particularities of the way privacy and personal data are managed (or should we better say mismanaged?) into the online sphere – that is more personal data being collected by digital means and used in so many ways, it is even <a href="https://datadetox.myshadow.org/detox">hard to imagine</a>.</p>

              <p>This chapter will not include the cases that only relate to the right to privacy in the digital world, as that will fall beyond the scope of the current brochure. And they would probably deserve a dedicated analysis and comment. There are already several factsheets produced by the Court’s press unit that cover the right to privacy, such as New technologies - <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_New_technologies_ENG.pdf">http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_New_technologies_ENG.pdf</a> Right to the protections of one’s image - <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Own_image_ENG.pdf">http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Own_image_ENG.pdf</a> and Personal data protection - http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Data_ENG.pdf Mass surveillance - <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Mass_surveillance_ENG.pdf">http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Mass_surveillance_ENG.pdf</a> , Surveillance at workplace - <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Workplace_surveillance_ENG.pdf">http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Workplace_surveillance_ENG.pdf </a></p>

              <p>Another key subject with which freedom of expression enters in conflict is intellectual property rights, and especially copyright. These tensions tend to be more significant in the digital world, when copying large amounts of works becomes technically easier and the digital copy is identical to the original.</p>
              <p>In this specific domain, the ECtHR has had just a few cases and a rather straightforward general line. At the same time, we note that the European Court of Justice has had its share of decisions that touched also on the conflict between freedom of expression and intellectual property rights – as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</p>
              <p>First, we need to clarify that the ECtHR considers that intellectual property is a form of property and thus is covered by Article 1 of the Protocol no. 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights:</p>

              <h4 class="azure largechar">Art. 1 Protection of property</h4>
              <p class="largechar">Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.</p>
              <cite>“In the light of the above-mentioned decisions, the Grand Chamber agrees with the Chamber’s conclusion that <span class="pinkish"><strong>Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is applicable to intellectual property as such.</strong></span>”</cite>
              <p class="refer">Anheuser-Busch Inc. v. Portugal [Grand Chamber], 2007</p>

              <p>Similar to the cases of conflict with privacy, in this situation the Court also needs to do a balancing exercise between two rights established by the Convention. In these cases when the exercise has been done by the national courts based on the criteria from the Court jurisprudence, usually the ECtHR intervenes only if there are very strict arguments for the case to be revisited.</p>

              <h4 class="azure largechar"><img src="img/key.svg" alt="element cheie">Key aspects from relevant ECtHR cases:</h4><br>
              <h4 class="azure largechar">There is a wide margin of appreciation from the national authorities in these cases</h4>
              <cite>“<span class="pinkish"><strong>The domestic authorities had a particularly wide margin of appreciation in this case considering the aim of the interference</strong></span> and the fact that, as Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 applied to intellectual property, the interference was also aimed at protecting rights safeguarded by the Convention or its Protocols.”</cite>
              <p class="refer">Ashby Donald and Others v. France, 2013</p>

              <h4 class="azure largechar">A copyright conviction is an interference with the freedom of expression</h4><br>

              <cite>“In the present case, <span class="pinkish"><strong>the applicants put in place the means for others to impart and receive information within the meaning of Article 10 of the Convention</strong></span>. The Court considers that the actions taken by <span class="pinkish"><strong>the applicants are afforded protection under Article 10 § 1 of the Convention and, consequently, the applicants’ convictions interfered with their right to freedom of expression</strong></span>. Such interference breaches Article 10 unless it was “prescribed by law”, pursued one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in Article 10 § 2 and was “necessary in a democratic society” to attain such aim or aims.”</cite>
              <p class="refer">Neij and Sunde Kolmisoppi v. Sweden, 2013</p>

              <cite>“The Court concludes that the <span class="pinkish"><strong>publication of the contentious photographs on a website</strong></span> dedicated to fashion and publicly offering the images of parades for free or paid and for sale <span class="pinkish"><strong>is the exercise of the right to freedom of expression</strong></span>, and that the applicants’ conviction for these acts amount to an interference with this right.”</cite>
              <p class="refer">Ashby Donald and Others v. France, 2013</p><br>

              <h4 class="azure largechar">The safeguards for “commercial” speech are much lower than the ones for political or other public interest speech</h4><br>

              <cite>“In this connection, the Court would also underline that the width of the margin of appreciation afforded to States varies depending on a number of factors, among which the type of information at issue is of particular importance. In the present case, although protected by Article 10, the safeguards afforded to the distributed material in respect of which the applicants were convicted cannot reach the same level as that afforded to political expression and debate. It follows that the nature of the information at hand, and the balancing interest mentioned above, both are such as to afford the State a wide margin of appreciation which, when accumulated as in the present case, makes the margin of appreciation particularly wide.”</cite>
              <p class="refer">Neij and Sunde Kolmisoppi v. Sweden, 2013</p>

              <cite>“Contracting states have a wide margin of appreciation when they regulate the freedom of expression in the commercial sphere, given that the scope of the expression must be relativized when it’s not about the expression strictly “commercial”​ of such individual but his participation in a debate concerning the public interest”.</cite>
              <p class="refer">Ashby Donald and Others v. France, 2013</p>

              <h4 class="azure largechar">Criminal copyright conviction and damage could be proportional</h4>
              <cite>“Finally, the Court reiterates that the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 10. In the present case, the Court considers that the prison sentence and award of damages cannot be regarded as disproportionate. In reaching this conclusion, the Court has regard to the fact that the domestic courts found that the applicants had not taken any action to remove the torrent files in question, despite having been urged to do so. Instead they had been indifferent to the fact that copyright-protected works had been the subject of file-sharing activities (...)”</cite>

              <p>Article 10, paragraph 2 of the Convention lists the interests that can be protected when limiting the right to freedom of expression. Besides the interests in the protection of the reputation or rights of others, or the prevention of the disclosure of information received in confidence, that were discussed in the previous chapters, other interests are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>national security, territorial integrity or public safety; the prevention of disorder or crime;</li>
                <li>the protection of health or morals;</li>
                <li>maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Even if, when reading the paragraph 2 of Article 10, someone might think that the Convention text allows a blanket limitation of the right to freedom of expression, for the listed interests, the jurisprudence of the ECtHR has detailed when such limitation might be “necessary in a democratic society”, as well as when that might not be the case, and the right to freedom of expression prevails.</p>
              <p>While there are cases when expression limitations are upheld by the ECtHR, there is also a large array of cases where the member states of the Council of Europe were found in violation of Article 10, when attempting to protect the above listed interests.</p>
              <p>For example, the need to protect national security allows for limitations of the right to freedom of expression, but it has to be proved by authorities that these limitations are indeed necessary in a democratic society.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, in what regards pornography and blasphemy, these might be more easily limited in the interests of protecting health or morals. Protecting the rights of children is paramount. Child pornography is illegal.</p>

The Court reiterates that the mere fact that “information” or “ideas” offend, shock or disturb does not suffice to justify that interference (see paragraph 36 above). What is in issue in the instant case, however, is incitement to violence.”

              <p>There is a common understanding, reflected in the European legal systems, and the ECtHR jurisprudence, that there should exist no licensing systems for print publications.</p>
              <p>States must not have a say in the appearance on the market of a new publication, which definitely includes Internet publications, in all their forms and shapes. This is a basic principle of freedom of the press.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, there also exists an agreement that, for broadcast media, a licensing system should exist. This limitation is argued to come, amongst others, from the practical matter of a limited availability of broadcasting spectrum, and it brings with it further limitations, such as the existence of national broadcasting legislation that settles restrictive conditions for broadcasting (for example, limitative programming requirements). National broadcasting supervision authorities are established in the European states for the implementation of such legislation.</p>

              <h4 class="azure largechar">The denial of registration for a publication has to be an objective and foreseeable measure</h4><br/>

              <cite><span class="pinkish"><strong>“the relevant law must provide a clear indication of the circumstances where such restraints are permissible, and, a fortiori, when the consequences of the restraint, as in the present case, are to block completely publication of a periodical</strong></span>. This is so because of the potential threat that such prior restraints, by their very nature, pose to the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 10”.</cite>

              <h4 class="azure largechar">Audiovisual media can be regulated more strictly than the press</h4><br>

              <cite><span class="pinkish"><strong>“States are permitted to regulate by a licensing system the way in which broadcasting is organised in their territories, particularly in its technical aspects</strong></span> (….). Technical aspects are undeniably important, but the grant or refusal of a licence may also be made conditional on other considerations, including such matters as the nature and objectives of a proposed station, its potential audience at national, regional or local level, the rights and needs of a specific audience and the obligations deriving from international legal instruments.</cite>

              <h4 class="azure largechar">Pluralism – key for the free communication of information and ideas</h4><br>

              <cite>(…) The Court has frequently stressed the fundamental role of freedom of expression in a democratic society, in particular where, through the press, it serves to impart information and ideas of general interest, which the public is moreover entitled to receive (...). Such an undertaking cannot be successfully accomplished unless it is grounded in <span class="pinkish"><strong>the principle of pluralism, of which the State is the ultimate guarantor</strong></span>. This observation is especially valid in relation to audiovisual media, whose programmes are often broadcast very widely.”</cite>
